# GMF Financial Forecasting

This repository contains my work as a Financial Analyst for Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments. The project focuses on preprocessing financial data (TSLA, BND, SPY) from YFinance, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building time series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict Teslaâ€™s stock prices for portfolio optimization.

## Objectives
- Preprocess historical data (2015-2025) for analysis.
- Analyze trends, volatility, and risk metrics (VaR, Sharpe Ratio).
- Forecast TSLA prices to recommend portfolio adjustments.
